                <p class="text-faded">This project is aimed at collecting real-time news and events on the Internet and provides sentiment analysis function of the news, which determines whether the attitude of the news is positive or negative. Besides, point the locations that the news happened on a map in different colors to show the attitude of the news, as well as a 3D earth. The program also shows the news or events literally including the information( content, location, attitude, post date...) of the news or events.</p>

It consists of a series of elements. Its  elements tell the browser how to display the content. Its elements are represented by tags Its tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Browsers do not display the Its tags, but use them to render the content of the page. <br>
 
python <br>Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It usually works well for imperative and object-oriented functional programming. It has a comprehensive and large standard library that has automatic memory management and dynamic features<br>
 
Flask <br>Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.<br> 
 
Flask offers suggestions but not enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy.  <br>

                <p class="text-faded">This mobile game is developed on WeChat Platform, WeChat is the most popular multi-functional app in China. To finish this project, I used WXML, WXSS and JavaScript, which is very similar with HTML and CSS. However, these were still new languages to me, but I learned it very fast and finished the development in a week.<br>This is a mobile game of composing and creating ancient Chinese character. Users can see the corresponding "Oracle bone script" of the image with an effect of card-turnover by click on the card. LongClick the card, the element will display at the central area of the screen, users can move, zoom in and out, or rotate the element. Users can also draw the shape they want on the canvas, which can be moved, zoomed in or out and rotated as well. Finally, users can save the picture that they created to their local cellphone album.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">— social media orientated</h3>
                <p class="text-faded">Due to the volume of data produced on social media is extremely huge, we expect to
implement the system on the basis of easily fetching popular topics and handily extracting
subtle information to help people knowing what they are talking about on social media. We
propose to achieve the project from the following aspects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Ability to process real-time data and update the model periodically.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Topics are integrated with the past and current data in order to observe the trend of the
topic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● The system capability can process volume data under the stable situation to guarantee
efficiency and sensitivity of emerging topics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Visualization of statistical results.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Details</h2>
                <p>The Data mining and visualization system is a web-based product, and the front-end is experimental setup by computer language HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Nodejs. The system is available to run on any PC accompanying with well-setup back-end environment which installed Flask, Tweepy, and MongoDB. <br>

The implementation details can be divided mainly to 5 units based on the functions, which GUI, API calling, line chart, pie chart and 3D global earth.<br>
                </p>  <h4>1)	GUI</h4> <br>
<p>
The elements (input, line charts, pie charts, 3D global) of the webpage is directly hypertext reference Bootstrap (the world’s most popular front-end component library) stylesheet and Echarts (A Declarative Framework for Rapid Construction of Web-based Visualization). All the components are placed by using existing template from GitHub.<br>

There are 2 webpage in this system, one is search page, and the other is using keywork to extract data to display data in specific diagrams, e.g. line chart, pie chart and 3D global. <br>

                </p> <br>  <h4>2)	API calling</h4> <br><p>
                API calling is designed to retrieved JSON data from local back-end through URL by using Ajax GET request.For the interface, the API calling program will provide keywordData with one parameter keyword.<br>

                </p>
               <h4>3)	Line chart</h4> <br><p>
                The response data returns from API is in JSON format. In order to fit in the code provided by Echarts Line chart, the data should be formatted to xAxis (represent the week from Mon. to Sun.) and yAxis (represent the total amount of a specific tweets all around the world).<br>To be specific the data in line.data is an array [‘Mon’, ‘Tue’, ‘Wed’, ‘Thu’, ‘Fri’, ‘Sat’, ‘Sun’] and the line.vaule is the according amount of tweets which are [2919, 2238,  2453, 3479, 3397, 2429, 2627]. <br>

                </p>
                <h4>4)	Pie chart</h4> <br><p>
                The return data form backend of each continent is  <br>
Pie: [{value: 2488, name: 'Asia'},<br>
            {value: 4394, name: 'Africa'},<br>
            {value: 8998, name: 'NorthAmerica'},<br>
            {value: 1863, name: 'SouthAmerica'},<br>
            {value: 1799, name: 'Europe'}]<br>
To put the above data into Pie chart, simply provide the pie to include all the return value<br>

                </p>
                 <h4>5)	3D global</h4> <br><p>
                The data return is global: [{longitude, latitude, density}, …],  before directly put the data into 3D global, the data need be  reformatted as the Echarts request.<br> Then the data can be processed by 3D global to pin the each light point. <br>
